        <span id="mhix-span"> mhix's website </span>


        <p id="mhix-introduction-span"> mhix was 15 years old when he made this, he was a professional gamer and
            streamer. then he got interested in coding which was the reason why he made this website. taking time to
            consider his direction of life, he eventually decided to completely ditch the dream of being a professional
            gamer and pursue to become a programmer instead. however he's still passionate on the concept of
            entertaining people as the hobby of his own. he wanted to become a game developer in the future to produce
            his own company and game variety. 2022, 03, 04. :)
